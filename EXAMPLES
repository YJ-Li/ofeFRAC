Go to folder tests/ for some examples.

1. tests/linear-elasticity: stress analysis of a linear elastic solid
2. tests/delamination:      delamination of a DCB using zero-thickness interface elements
3. tests/damage:            fracture of a four-point bending test using the gradient enhanced damage model
4. tests/soil:              soil consolidation test with u-p formulation of poro-elasticity

For any test, the folder contains:
1. *.geo : Gmsh geometry file 
2. *.msh : Gmsh msh file (these 2 files were created using Gmsh)
3. *.mesh: jive mesh file (converted from *.msh using ciGEN)
4. *.data: jive data file: mesh + boundary conditions 
5. *.pro : jive properties file

To run a test do:

../../standard/fefrac *.pro

or with the optimised executable

../../standard/fefrac-opt *.pro

VTU files will be created, which can be opened using PARAVIEW.
