# ofeFRAC
ofeFRAC is a C++ finite element code for modelling fracture and damage of solids. It implements
1. non-local integral damage model
2. gradient-enhanced damage model
3. zero-thickness cohesive interface elements (2D and 3D problems)
4. u-p for porous media (fully saturated)

ofeFRAC, written on top of jive (https://software.dynaflow.com/jive/), is described in the following paper:
